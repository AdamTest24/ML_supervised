That would be a classification based on the weight alone. It also appears that the data points classified as 'male' are taller on average, so it might be helpful to have the height recorded as well. E.g it could improve the prediction of gender for new subjects with a weight around 70 kg. But it would not be the best choice if only a single quantity was used.
